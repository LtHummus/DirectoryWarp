# DirectoryWarp

This is a little project that I wrote to help me get better at the programming language [Go](https://golang.org). Think of this project as `cd` with bookmarks. You can bookmark locations and then jump to them easily.

This is still a work in progress for now as I am learning. Most of the functionality is there, but I need to write some documentation (as I'm sure you've noticed) and some refactoring is in order. Also I need a shell script written to actually change the directories.
